## Hey there, I'm <span style="color: rgba(var(--color-accent),var(--tw-text-opacity))">Jeff!</span>

I'm a data scientist from New Zealand passionate about data science and machine learning (obviously), Linux, software engineering, DevOps, and open-source software.

The main tools I use for programming are:
- Bat
- Git
- Hyprland
- Kitty
- Neovim 
- NixOS, Nix, and Home-manager
- Ripgrep
- Starship prompt
- Tmux
- Yazi
- Zsh

As you might be able to tell, I like living in the terminal when I code. You can find my complete setup and configurations in my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/zenoix/walnut-environment).

I use NixOS on all my personal devices and Ubuntu+Nix+Home-manager on my work laptop (they don't allow anything other than Windows sadge). That allows my configurations to be as reproducible and transferable as they can.

My favourite language to write is Golang, but I use Python most, and that's what I'm most comfortable with.

Lastly, when I'm not coding, I enjoy eating delicious food, drinking tea, playing video games, exercising, watching anime, and learning 日本語.
