A large number of Python beginners and both professional and aspiring data scientists swear by code notebooks like Jupyter notebooks. So why do I, a data scientist, avoid notebooks? Read on to find out and to also learn what tools I use instead.

## What Are Notebooks and Why Do I Think People Use Them

Coding notebooks (like Jupyter notebooks) are a tool for people to combine code with rich text and images together into one file. 

With a notebook, you can write code in code "cells" and see the outputs of those cells when they're run right underneath the cell.

Commonly, these are interwoven with "text blocks" where text or markdown is written. This allows for an interactive environment to write code, see outputs, document logic, and tell stories all in one place.
